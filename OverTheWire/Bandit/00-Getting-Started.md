`**Note:**` This is for the users who are playing the Bandit in VM, you may fail to connect to overthewire.org via SSH with a "broken pipeline error" when the network adapter for the VM is configured to use NAT mode. Adding in the setting IPQoS throughput to /etc/ssh/ssh_config should resolve the issue.  
If this does not solve your issue, the only option then is to change the adapter to Bridged mode.  

`i) VM Adapter -> NAT -> Add IPQoS throughput -> /etc/ssh/ssh_config`  

or

`ii) VM Adapter -> Bridged Mode`
